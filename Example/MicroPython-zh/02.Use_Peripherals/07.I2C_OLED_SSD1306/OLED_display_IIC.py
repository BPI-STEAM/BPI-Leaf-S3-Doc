# ASCII printing characters (character encoding: 32-127)
# 32~126 (95 in total) are characters: 32 is a space, among which 48~57 are ten Arabic numerals from 0 to 9,
# 65ï½ž90 are 26 uppercase English letters,
# 97~122 are 26 lowercase English letters,
# The rest are some punctuation marks, operation symbols, etc.
# The 127th character represents the delete command on the keyboard.
# ASCII extension code (character encoding: 128-255)
# The last 128 are called extended ASCII codes.
# Many x86-based systems support the use of extended (or "high") ASCII.
# The extended ASCII code allows the 8th bit of each character 
# to be used to determine additional 128 special symbol characters, foreign language letters and graphic symbols.
